# For Margaret:
#
# Some notes:
# Cloning: creating a copy of a Github repo on your computer
# Forking: copying a repo from someone else's github to your computer
# Forking and cloning: use the function usethis::create_from_github() to
# copy a repo that you then can track and also suggest changes to.

# branch is a copy of the clone that I edit on my own and then can push to and pull from
# Margaret makes changes that clearly conflict too :/
